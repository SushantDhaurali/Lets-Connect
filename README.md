  My name is Sushant Dhaurali, I am currently 24 years old. I am a part-time student at my local college here in Maryland, Baltimore. I am in my first year of taking IT courses at Towson University. Currently, I have 0-1 years of experience in HTML, CSS, SEO Optimization and Web Development. I am a self-taught individual who has been working on many projects in my independent time. Currently, I am seeking a dedicated company that is willing to take me under their tutelage and guidance. I am a quick learner and a very outstanding disciple. My short-term goal is to land a part-time job working from home or in a remote nearby area while I pursue my undergraduate in Computer Science. I believe my willingness to learn plus my ability to work cooperatively will make me an ideal fit for any given role.
